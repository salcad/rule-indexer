## SOLID Principles in cross-Language development

In both the Java and Python versions of sample case of indexing system project, I have applied the 5 core SOLID principles to enhance the modularity, maintainability, and testability of the applications:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class is designed with a single responsibility. Logic classes such as `CapitalizedWordCountLogic` and `LongWordListLogic` focus solely on specific computations, while rule classes manage the application of these computations.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The system is structured to be open for extension but closed for modification. New rules can be seamlessly integrated by adding classes that implement the `IndexingRule` abstract base class without modifying existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subclasses are fully substitutable for their base classes. This ensures that all rule classes conform to the `IndexingRule` interface, allowing the `FileProcessor` to apply any rule uniformly.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Classes are not forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. The `IndexingRule` interface is designed to ensure that rule classes implement only those methods necessary for their specific tasks.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions. This principle is observed through the use of abstract classes and interfaces that dictate interaction patterns.

This adherence to SOLID principles is consistently maintained across both programming environments, demonstrating a robust application of software engineering best practices.
